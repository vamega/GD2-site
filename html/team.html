              I was the mastermind behind most of the artificial intelligence code in the game. The AI code was based mostly on Unity's Navigation Meshes which I mastered over this course.

              I don't play video games. Well maybe a few, and those I could be said to have played for a fair bit of time. I'd never played a hack-and-slash game before deciding to make this one, upon which I started playing TorchLight to try and understand what I was getting into.

              I'm a Computer Science major who's scheduled to graduate with the class of 2013. I used to be in the GSAS programme here, but realized that my heart really wasn't in it. I absolutely love programming and computer science stuff. Currently I'm enamoured with functional programming, and am trying to absorb as much about Haskell as I can.

              I'm going to be going on Co-Op (think of it as an extended internship) from June to January while working at TripAdvisor on their Scalability Team. Feel free to take a peek at my <a href="../assets/resumes/VarunMadiath-Resume.pdf">resume</a>.

              I'm majoring in Computer Science and expected to graduate this year (May 2012). I created all the particle effects for the player's attacks, and wrote the scripts to handle player movement and attack characteristics. My artistic skills were used to create the special effect icons in the game.
